Connecting Client to Server using Axios
In this task, I established communication between the client-side (front-end) and server-side (back-end) of your application using Axios. Axios is a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests, and it's commonly used in React applications to interact with APIs.

Axios Setup:
Installed Axios using npm.
Configured Axios to send requests to the server.

API Communication:
Utilized Axios to send HTTP requests from the client to the server.
Handled responses from the server in the client-side code.
Axios Interceptor for Token Handling
An Axios interceptor was implemented to enhance the handling of authentication tokens. Axios interceptors allow you to run your code or modify the request or response globally before they are sent or received.

Key points to consider:
Token Handling:
Implemented an interceptor to automatically include the authentication token in the request headers.
This ensures that the server can authenticate and authorize the user.
Styling with Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes styling the applications easy and efficient.

Key points to consider:
Tailwind CSS Integration:
Integrated Tailwind CSS in this task.
Utilized Tailwind's utility classes for styling components and layouts.
Followed a utility-first approach to build a visually appealing interface.
User Authentication
Login Functionality:
Implemented a user login system.
Users can log in using their name and email.
User Management (Add, Edit, Delete Users).

Adding Users:
Created functionality for adding new users to the system.

Editing Users:
Implemented the ability to edit existing user information.

Deleting Users:
Provided a mechanism for users to be deleted from the system.

Overall Summary
In summary, this task involved creating a React application that communicates with a server using Axios, ensuring secure authentication through token handling, styling the application with Tailwind CSS, and implementing user authentication and management features such as adding, editing, and deleting users.
